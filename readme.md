# appcache

A simple cache application in go, the goal is to make it simple to create a cache for simple one off "static" pages that request other resources, such as [https://lyon.lol](https://lyon.lol). This is designed in such a way that it is easy to simply 'throw it on a server' and make it work with an existing site.
